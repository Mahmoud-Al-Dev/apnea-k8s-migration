## 📌 Technical Project Overview

This project demonstrates an enterprise-grade, highly available MLOps lifecycle for a clinical sleep apnea diagnostic tool. It transitions the application from a traditional instance-based deployment to a fully orchestrated **Kubernetes (EKS)** environment. 

By implementing the **GitOps** methodology, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), and a comprehensive observability stack, this pipeline ensures that the deep learning inference engine (FastAPI) and interactive frontend (Streamlit) are resilient, self-healing, and continuously synchronized with the source repository.

## ⚙️ GitOps & Automation Workflow

The architecture utilizes a decoupled CI/CD pattern to completely separate continuous integration from continuous deployment, ensuring maximum security and state consistency:

* **Zero-Trust Secrets (HashiCorp Vault):** All AWS credentials and deployment tokens are completely removed from GitHub. The CI workflow authenticates via a machine-identity `AppRole` to dynamically fetch short-lived access keys.
* **Immutable Infrastructure (Terraform):** Defines the underlying AWS environment. It automatically provisions a multi-AZ VPC and the managed EKS Control Plane, deploying memory-optimized `t3.medium` worker nodes.
* **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):** Automates the testing, building, and packaging of the Python application containers upon every repository push.
* **Artifact Management (Sonatype Nexus):** Built containers and heavy PyTorch model weights are securely pushed to a private Nexus registry, bypassing standard Docker Hub limits and ensuring tight access control.
* **Continuous Deployment (ArgoCD):** Acts as the GitOps controller inside the EKS cluster. It continuously monitors the repository's `k8s/` manifests and automatically pulls state changes, instantly self-healing the infrastructure if live pods drift from the code.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Observability Deep Dive

A production AI system requires constant monitoring to track inference latency, hardware utilization, and potential bottlenecks. This deployment leverages the **"App of Apps"** GitOps pattern to inject a full enterprise monitoring suite:

* **Metrics Scraping (Prometheus):** Deployed via Helm through ArgoCD, bypassing EKS CRD limits using Server-Side Apply. It continuously scrapes CPU, RAM, and network metrics from the EC2 worker nodes and inference pods.
* **Hardware Telemetry (Node Exporters):** DaemonSets automatically deploy to every AWS worker node to expose deep system-level metrics directly to Prometheus.
* **Data Visualization (Grafana):** Connects directly to the Prometheus database to build centralized, dark-mode visual dashboards for real-time
